# The Docker needed contents include: Dockerfile, gen_flag
# This is can be used as a common Docker image that runs a python web server and
# complies with the way the backend is passing in dynamic flags.
# Only the CTF specific part of each Dockerfile and the gen_flag script
# need to be customized to suit the CTF.

# Using debian cause some C problems require gcc
FROM debian:latest
